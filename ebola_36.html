<tr><td>2015-03-29 17:30:54</td><td>The region's Ebola outbreak has killed more than 10,000 people since cases were first recorded more than a year ago, with most of the dead coming from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-29 17:30:54</td><td>Sierra Leone, which has seen the most cases, imposed a three-day lockdown that officials hoped would help the country get "total control" over Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-29 17:30:54</td><td>In Liberia, the government issued a statement Sunday warning survivors of Ebola to abstain from unprotected sex even beyond the 90-day period earlier recommended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-29 17:30:54</td><td>The statement was prompted by continued confusion over how the country's latest Ebola patient - its first in weeks - came down with the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-29 17:30:54</td><td>However, he was released from treatment about six months ago, and Ebola has not been detected in the semen of a survivor for longer than about three months.</td></tr>
